Todo:
    -   redis caching behaviour for various habit detail sections, i.e. expensive process to calculate
        and cache the results in redis for while?  sub results so completed weeks are cached but the current
        week gets recalculated each time?
    -   Dark theme

Done:
Add example tests hitting the docker compose containers
Add code coverage to output and make tests fail if threshold not met
cypress tests
